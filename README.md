# Machine-Learning-and-Deep-Learning-in-Agronomy
This repository introduces the utilization of machine learning and deep learning in agronomy. It is organized into four sections:

    Regression Machine Learning in Agronomy:
    This section explores how we analyze examples of crop yield prediction using machine learning regression models.

    Classification Models:
    The second section focuses on the treatment of classification models in agronomy.

    Introduction and Implementation of Neural Networks:
    The third section introduces and implements neural networks for various agronomic applications.

    Deep Learning in Agronomy:
    The fourth section delves into deep learning techniques, including Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) for forecasting and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for classification in agronomy.
